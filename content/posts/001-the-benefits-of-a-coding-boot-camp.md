excerpt: Is there a requirement to get a computer science degree or go to a bootcamp to get a job in web development?

This blog will discuss various web development topics, all from the perspective of a self-taught developer. It mentions very little about boot camps.

So why is the H1 "**_Who needs boot camp_**"?

It's a slightly provocative question. It's debatable. If you're a web developer or someone who aspires to be one, you'll probably sit firmly on one side of the debate or the other. Or you have a computer science degree and you think we're all clueless without one.

I'm on the fence about the debate, and perhaps there isn't really a debate worth talking about. One thing's for certain is that I didn't go to a boot camp. I'm a self-taught web developer. I'm unable to come off the fence on either side because I'm not yet a full-time developer.

I don't think a boot camp is essential. I've learnt many aspects of web development. I love web development, and I'll share some parts of my learning journey that I feel some people might find interesting. This will be from the perspective of someone who has largely learned the ropes on their own. 

Whether you're on the fence, a boot camper, or a self-taught pro, I hope you find some of what you read interesting. But first, let's take a step back to frame the debate.

## What even is a boot camp?

No, not that.

A popular AI language model, which is rapidly replacing Google as my go-to for most things, described a boot camp as:

 "_An intensive, short-term training program designed to teach individuals the skills and knowledge needed to become proficient software developers. These boot camps typically focus on practical, hands-on learning and aim to prepare students for entry-level positions in the software development industry in a condensed timeframe, often spanning a few months. Boot camps cover a range of programming languages, development tools, and best practices, providing a fast track for individuals seeking to transition into a career in software development._"

They can be quite expensive, sometimes over $20k, and you either cram them into intense evenings of learning, or you're not in work while in attendance. But lots of people swear by them. Why? There are a few likely reasons:

### A learning structure designed for retention

**Tutorial hell** is when you spend an exorbitant amount of time watching videos and not practicing. When you get around to implementing things, the newly learned skills you thought you had vanish. 

There's a way to learn, and there's a way to remember what you've learned. Try it, fail or succeed, try it more than once, and try it in a slightly new way. That's how to remember something new. Explaining something to someone, even if you've only just learned it, helps you retain that information.

It's all easy to NOT do when learning by yourself. Boot camps are designed so that you retain the knowledge. 

### A community

Your instructor(s) will know their stuff. Or they're hustlers. They will tell you the latest things to learn and why. Your fellow boot campers will have their own opinions. Both will be on hand to keep you motivated, keep you from being lazy, and shirking off the practice, and for help and advice.

If you learn by yourself, a bunch of Discord server pals isn't quite the same. A support community is probably a big plus of boot camps.

### Job entries

How to apply, what to apply to, when to apply, how to prepare, and maybe even putting in a good word for you. I'm guessing a bit here, but helping you to land that first job is a service often cited in boot camp marketing.

## Who knows and who cares

Perhaps a boot camp does make getting that first job easier. I don't really know how much I believe the course provider's confidence in employment following the course. Although if they offered a money-back guarantee, that would be convincing. 

In the absence of that, I'm going to carry on my self-taught web dev learning experiment and write a little bit about it along the way. Hope you can join...
