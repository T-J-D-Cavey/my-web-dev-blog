Who Needs What? Who Needs A Boot Camp? 

That's what I'm getting at. That's the overiding theme of this blog, and its posts. In case you were wondering, I don't have a computer science degree, and I didn't go to a boot camp. I'm self-taught. Although I'm not a full time developer (yet), so I'm not any closer to knowing the answers from personal experience. 

## What even is a boot camp?

A popular AI language model, which is rapidly replacing Google as my go-to for most things, described a boot camp as:

 _an intensive, short-term training program designed to teach individuals the skills and knowledge needed to become proficient software developers. These boot camps typically focus on practical, hands-on learning and aim to prepare students for entry-level positions in the software development industry in a condensed timeframe, often spanning a few months. Boot camps cover a range of programming languages, development tools, and best practices, providing a fast track for individuals seeking to transition into a career in software development._

They cost a bomb. Sometimes over $20k, and you either do them in your evenings after a day's work. Or you're not in work whilst in attendance. But lots of people swear by them. Why? There's a few likely reasons:

### A learning structure designed for retention

**Tutorial hell** is when you spend an exorbatant about of time wathcing videos and not practicing. When you get round to implementing things, the newly learnt skills you thought you had vanish. There's a way to learn and there's a way to remember what you've learnt. Doing, doing it wrong and finding the answer, doing it more than once and doing it in a slightly new way is how to remember something new. Better yet, explaining it to someone. All of this is easy to not do when learning by yourself. Boot camps are designed so that you retain the knowledge. 

### A community

Your instructor(s) will know their stuff. Or they're a con artist hustler. They will tell you the latest things to learn and why. Your fellow boot campers will have their own opinions. Both will be on hand to keep you motivated, keep you from being lazy and shirking off the practice, and for help and advice. If you learn by yourself, a bunch of Discord server pals isn't quite the same.

### Job entries

How to apply, what to apply to, when to apply. How to prepare. Maybe even putting in a good word for you. I'm guesing a bit here but landing that first job, or helping to, is a service often sited in boot camp marketing.  

Perhaps a boot camp does make getting that first job easier. I don't really know how much I believe the course provider's confidence in employment following the course. Although if they offered a money back guarantee I might be persuaded. In the absence of that, I'm going to carry on my self taught web dev learning experiment and write a little bit of it along the way.
