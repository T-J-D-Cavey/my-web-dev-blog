I always remember that brown bear web page that looked like it was from the 90's. 

A picture of one featured in one of the sections of the HTML course hosted by Codecademy, a popular online platform that offers interactive coding and programming courses. I had already completed the HTML and CSS course, which introduced core concepts like HTML tags and the 'document object model' (DOM) with, amongst other things a pretend web page all about bears. 

The course only covered HTML and CSS. I finished the course and moved on. Javascript, along with everything else remained an unknown unknown. 

Some time later I secured a promotion at work which saw me take on responsibility for an enterprise-level online community forum site. The site was built and maintained by a software company, via a software as a service arrangement. That means I had access to technical expertese if I required it. But still, I felt the need to take a second look at that brown bear web page.

## Codecademy Front End Career Path

They offered more than HTML + CSS courses. They offered 'career paths'. It's a fancy name but it translated to a range of courses on a range of subjected that someone would need to know for a career in that area. 'Back end' and 'Full stack' were the other options. I stuck with the bears.  

The HTML and CSS course modules were included in the career path package. I had been there and done that, although I was grateful for the chance to revise. It even remembeed my place in each module (the final section), as if it had been yesterday.

## Would I recommend it?

Yes. It or something like it. 

Looking back now, I'm grateful I had a structured learning journey. Being self taught doesn't mean you have to build the curriculum. It just means you have to be honest when you mark your own work. The range of subjects and lessons was extensive. It was designed like how I imagine a coding boot camp would be, perhaps just a bit less intense and more steady. 

## A comprehensive structure

It had the obvious HTML, CSS, the fundamentals of web design, JavaScript was a big section. It also included things that might not have been obvious to a novice to learn but which are part of a common front end web developer's work flow:

- VSCode
- Git / Github
- Browser dev tools
- Testing

It covered Javascript libraries React and Redux that are still popular today. Data structures and algorhtyms for goodness sake. I was starting to the miss bears. 

Technical interview questions, CV writing, it had an aim and that aim was to make me employable as a front end web developer. 

## Learning and doing

The Codecademy user interface is very impressive. It simulates a development environment integrated into your browsing window, a virtual browsing window alongside it, and informative text and animated step-by-step list instructions on the other side.

It meant I had to read and then implement what I had read almost immediately. In tiny bite sized pieces. Then at the end of the module there was a practice project (for paid members only). One last time to do what I had learnt, before moving on. 

## Learning vs doing

That might be my only critisism: the structure of the Codecademy career path curriculum didn't allow for much time to practice multiple new skills in a real world scenario. You learnt, you did, perhaps you did it again, and then you moved on. All emcompassing projects were few and far between. 

As I'm beginning to appreciate that the learning never stops in web development, I also now appreciate the need to implement learnings after every new library, language or framework. My year is now divded up into weeks or months of either learning or implementing what I've just learnt.

The amount of missunderstandings or forgotten details that float to the service when trying to bring it all together in a practic project make it clear how valuable this is. 

## Thanks to the bears

I now look back at that first HTML course and the brown bears web page with a sense of regret that it didn't inspire me to carry on learning. It took a promotion at work to make me revisit, and there's a sense that I'm a couple of years behind my new career path. 

I'm good at stopping those pointless feelings of regret and focusing on what I can control and change in the NOW. I recommend everyone to do the same when possible.
