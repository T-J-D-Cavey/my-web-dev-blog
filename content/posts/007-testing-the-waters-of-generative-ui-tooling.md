I'm not an expert, or even that interested in cybersecurity. I know enough to know it's important. 

I've read articles documenting the ongoing, changing threats that exist in our online and digital worlds. Some state-sponsered, some not. All of it is ugly and filled with malice, or ruthlessly focused on making money, no matter the impact on victims. Either way, buckle up and be ready because they're coming for all of us sooner or later. 

With this in mind, companies of all shapes and sizes know that they have a responsibility to design a safe and secure system for their business and for their customers. Single sign-on (SSO) or multi-factor authentication (MFA) flows aim at making sure the person logging in is actually you. SSO also makes logging in easy on devices where you're signed in to that provider. That is an example of a win-win scenario for security and the user experience (UX). We need more of those.

## More room for UX improvements

Win win scenarios aren't always available though. [My previous post](005-digital-darwinism-and-bad-ux) outlined how I believe the presence of poorly designed digital experiences are an indication of the amount of progress we should expect (or hope for) in the coming years, as the technology evolves and matures. I have another example to share that relates to online security:

Here is each step I have to take every time I want to log in to my [Virgin Money Cash ISA (individual savings account)](https://uk.virginmoney.com/): 

1) Navigate to the Virgin Money website.
2) Click the 'Sign In' button.
3) Choose a financial product from the menu, such as 'Savings' or 'Current Accounts.'
4) Select the appropriate radio button that corresponds to the starting digits of your sort code.
5) Enter your Customer ID.
6) Enter the specified characters (e.g., the 8th, 17th, and 21st characters) of your 24-character password.
7) Check your phone for the authentication code sent via SMS and enter it.

First off, if I know my password, why can't I submit it in its entirety? How is it any more secure to ask me to figure out the 8th, 17th and 21st character of my password? Who came up with that?! Secondly I find it peculiar that I have to work out which financial product I have in the eyes of Virgin. They have my details on their system. Why can't they work it out when I log in? What is the security advantage of having a cap on the number of characters allowed in my password? 

Should Virgin Money improve my experience, or should I adjust my expectations and sense of perspective? After all, the consequences of a breach in security, and a hostile actor gaining access to my bank account far outweighs a clunky logging in experience. 

SSO and MFA are applications of technology for the purpose of protection. Are there others we can consider? My smart phone has a camera and a fingerprint sensor. Why don't I get given the choice to 'Log in on mobile device' and have these options to prove my identity? 

Perhaps there are flaws and risks to this approach that I am unaware of. Either way, I think designers need to have more robust conversations with their security and engineering colleagues when designing secure user journeys. It's in the interest of the company and of the end user.

I ended up leaving Virgin Money for a [Chip account](https://getchip.uk). Their app is excellent. Perhaps customers like me, voting with our feet, will be the motivating force that compels companies lagging behind on technology (usually legacy incumbents) to change their ways...
