Single-page-applications (SPA) became very popular in the mid teens. Having a way to manage their state on the client side was an interesting problem to solve. 

In response to the increasing complexity and interactiveness of modern web apps (web pages became web apps you might say), SPAs helped to avoid having to fetch every new section of a site from static served pages, at the cost of a second a two. 

A server of an SPA could send one bare bones HTML page in respones to the request to their domain with a very large bundled package of JavaScript. This script ran on the browser and created the DOM that the browser needed. With this, everything was there and ready to be rendered on the DOM. Nothing needed to be fetched. What was rendered depended on the state of the app. 

Angular was the first popular SPA JavaScript library. React and Vue followed. React seemed to be the most popular and was the library I learnt. For anyone unfamilier with what React is 'under the hood', I would would recommend [this talk by Tejas Kumar](https://youtu.be/f2mMOiCSj5c?si=Lrg_G-d06Zz3u9Sa).

## Codecademy Front-End Career Path

They offered more than an HTML and CSS course. They offered 'career paths.' It's a fancy name, but it consisted of several modules on a range of subjects that someone would need to know for a career in that area. 'Back end' and 'Full stack' were the other options. I stuck with the bears.

The HTML and CSS course modules were included in the career path package. I was grateful for the chance to revise it. The platform even remembered my place in each module, which, as you might imagine, tended to be the final section of every module.

## Would I recommend it?

Yes. It or something like it.

Looking back now, I'm grateful I had a structured learning journey. Being self-taught doesn't mean you have to build the curriculum. It just means you have to be honest when you mark your own work. The range of subjects and lessons was extensive. It was designed like how I imagine a coding boot camp would be, perhaps just a bit less intense and more steady.

## A comprehensive structure

It had the obvious HTML, CSS, the fundamentals of web design, JavaScript was a significant section. It also included things that might not have been obvious to a novice to learn but which are part of a common front-end web developer's workflow:

- VSCode
- Git/Github
- Browser dev tools
- Testing

It covered JavaScript libraries: React and Redux. It discussed and got us practicing coding with data structures and algorithms. I was starting to miss how simple that bears web page was. Technical interview questions, CV writing, the list goes on.

It had an aim, and that aim was to make me employable as a front-end web developer.

## Learning and doing

The Codecademy user interface is very impressive. It simulates a development environment integrated into your browsing window, a virtual browsing window alongside it, and informative text and animated step-by-step list instructions on the other side.

It meant I had to read and then implement what I had read almost immediately, in tiny bite-sized pieces. Then, at the end of the module, there was a practice project (for paid members only). One last time to do what I had learned before moving on.

## Learning vs doing

That might be my only criticism: the structure of the Codecademy career path curriculum didn't allow for much time to practice multiple new skills in a real-world scenario. I learned, I did, perhaps I did it again, and then I had to move on. All-encompassing projects were few and far between.

I'm beginning to appreciate that the learning never stops in tech; I also now appreciate the need to implement learnings after every new library, language, or framework. My year is now divided up into weeks or months of either learning or implementing what I've just learned.

The amount of misunderstandings or forgotten details. My shortcomings are exposed trying to bring it together in a practical project. Exposed and then rectified.

## Thanks to the bears

I now look back at that first HTML course and the brown bears' web page with a sense of regret that it didn't inspire me to carry on learning. It took a promotion at work to make me revisit, and there's a sense that I'm a couple of years behind my new career path.

I'm good at stopping those pointless feelings of regret and focusing on what I can control and change in the NOW. I recommend everyone do the same when possible.
